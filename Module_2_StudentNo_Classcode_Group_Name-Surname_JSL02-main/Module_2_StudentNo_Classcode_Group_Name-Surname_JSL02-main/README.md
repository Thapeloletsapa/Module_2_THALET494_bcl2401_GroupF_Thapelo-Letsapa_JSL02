# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

# learning Reflections README

**Debugging Brief:**
In the previous code, users could add the same fitness goal multiple times, leading to duplicate entries in the goal list. To enhance the user experience and prevent duplicates, I implemented a check to ensure that the same goal cannot be added more than once. If a duplicate goal is detected, it will not be added to the list.


Debugging Duplicate Goals
Overview
Throughout the build of these components , i had the opportunity to practice with JavaScript, and fetching different nodes from the DOM to enhance user experience. This was also a great way to start practicing how to debugg code like a pro.

### Reflections

**JavaScript**:
I'm slowly grasping understanding the DOM and how to use the different methods to fetch elements from The html file and how to manipulate them according to the required outcomes.
